# 🧪 Manage Virtual Machines

## 📘 Overview  
This repository documents the full walkthrough of **Lab: Manage Virtual Machines** from the AZ-104 certification track. It includes step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and commentary for deploying, scaling, and automating Azure Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS).

All tasks were completed in a secure campus lab environment using the Azure Portal, PowerShell, and CLI. Screenshots are used in place of screen recordings due to security restrictions.
